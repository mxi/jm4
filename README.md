# jm4

An implementation of the M4 macro text processor
as specified by 
[Kernighan & Ritchie](https://wolfram.schneider.org/bsd/7thEdManVol2/m4/m4.pdf).

The primary intent of this project is to facilitate
a fast, robust macro processing library to be used
in build systems such as Gradle or Maven to generate
templated files using the well-established and
versatile macro processing language that is M4.
